<wininst> is either the path to a GOG Windows game installer executable
or the path to a folder where such a game has already been installed (this is
where you would find "gog.ico").

<linuxinst> is either the path to a GOG Linux game installer executable or
the path to a folder where such a game has already been installed (this is
where you would find "gameinfo")

<outdir> points to a folder under which temporary games installations (if
required) are placed, plus which any files needed by this script. The final
delta script is also stored there, named gogdiff_delta.sh.

<compopts> are passed to tar when compressing Linux-only files, and also
stored in the delta script. The default is -z, which result in an gzipped tar.

<firststep> is the script step where to start. It can be used to skip
steps such as game installations, that have already been done. Steps are:
windows, linuz, digest, script.
